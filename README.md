# OpenSCAD projects
This repo contains SCAD code for things I've 3D printed - you can also find most of the STLs on
[Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/darkmidnight/designs).

* [G3A Battery Holder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2996917) - A holder for 2 small G3A cell batteries. Uses a paper clip to create the connection.

* [Lighter Driver Bit Holder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3008641) - An insert for Zippo or similar lighters which can be used to hold screwdriver bits.

* **Pen Plotter** - A pen plotter made from components scavenged from old printers and scanners and held together with these 3D printed structures.
